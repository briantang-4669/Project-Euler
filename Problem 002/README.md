## Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated y adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 
<p align="center">1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, . . .</p>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whos values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
